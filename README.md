# Harry-potter-Invisible-Cloak

Hello World, we have covered 4 blogs together. Thank you so much,for the support in our journey. Today let’s learn something interesting,
lets do some magic using computer vision. I hope you all know about Harry Potter’s ‘invisible cloak’, 
the one he uses to become invisible. We will see how we can do the same magic trick with the help of computer vision. 
I will cook some code with Python and use the OpenCV library.
